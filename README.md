## Project Description

This is a note taker application that uses the Express.js as the back end. With the front end (client-side) already provided, I was tasked with integrating the server side component of the note taker in order to allow the smooth operation of the application.

## Installation

First, begin by cloning this repository onto a directory of your choice. Then, open the file in a coding editor and open the terminal. Once the termial is open, install express using "npm install express".

## Usage

After installation, run the code in the terminal by first using 'node server.js'. An indicator stating 'API server now on port [port number]!' should appear. Once this is complete, the Note Taker application should be ready for use.

## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in my project; however, I will not be accepting contibutors for my project.

## Tests

Test this code by following the installation and usage guides. You can also used the deployed application link.
